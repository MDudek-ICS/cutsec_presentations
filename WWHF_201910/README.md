Architecting Secure ICS Environments

== Abstract

Criminals are hacking Industrial Control Systems (ICS). Their motivations are as diverse as the environments where ICS solutions and devices are found. Businesses are taking notice and asking the hard question: "how do we secure systems at are intended to run continuously?" The personnel operating these environments need to understand IT security as much as IT security professionals need to understand the concepts and requirements of an ICS implementation. The purpose of this presentation will be to, briefly, introduce the concepts and security considerations for ICS devices and solutions. It will brush on common devices and implementations while providing an overview of the methodologies used to architect and secure ICS environments. Attendees will walk away with an excellent starting point for assisting with the security of a business' ICS deployments in a manner that facilitates safety and business-centric decisions.
