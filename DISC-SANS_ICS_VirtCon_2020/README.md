## Title

Assessing and Exploiting Control Systems Analyzing

## Abstract
 
Security assessments help an organization understand the strengths and weaknesses of a technology. Technologies that provide public access to an environment, particularly those with operational technologies, deserve a very close look. This presentation will focus on reviewing the capabilities of a wireless gateway, identifying the potential attacks on the technology, and outlining the methods to mitigate the threats.
