== Title

Assessments in Active ICS Environments

== Abstract
 
Security assessments and penetration testing are performed by teams who you have allowed into your networks. But, how is this accomplished when your systems are in continuous production? How do you identify security concerns without disrupting your processes or production servers / devices?

This presentation will outline the aspects of how to review your Windows deployment in your production environment. How can you prepare? What actions will the testing team do? What results should you expect? This way your team can evaluate what security before the assessment and be ready for external security teams when they do come in to review your implementations.
