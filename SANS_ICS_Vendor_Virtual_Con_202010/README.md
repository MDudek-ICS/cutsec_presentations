# SANS ICS Vendor Virtual Conference 202010

## Title

How can organizations prepare their IT and OT teams to be ready for security incidents?

## Abstract

Most organizations focus their information technology (IT) and operational technology (OT) teams on securing the control network and gathering as much information as possible. The tasks associated with improving brown field environments or engineering green fields environments with the appropriate design requirements typically necessitates large investment in work hours. Solutions are often a conglomeration of technologies that are stitched together by sweat, creativity, and ingenuity. The end result is an influx of information that needs to be stored, correlated, analyzed, and monitored. The result is actionable intelligence that allows leadership to make informed decisions and improve the organization’s security program in line with the direction and goals of the control network.
 
Many organizations would consider this a success, and it is. But this influx of information will, eventually, lead to the identification of anomalous events. These events will lead to the identification of malicious activity. What does your team do now? The incident responses plans for most organizations are geared to their corporate environment and assets. They are not consistent with the technologies and operational requirements of the control network. Organizations that fail to prepare their team to handle actual security incidents will experience increased downtime and difficulties returning to 100 percent production. Response and recovery is just as important to an organization as the deployment of technologies designed for prevention and identification.
 
How can organizations prepare their IT and OT teams to be ready for security incidents? What are the techniques and tools the teams can use to improve the identification, containment, and eradication of suspicious or malicious activities to improve response times and reduce recovery efforts? This briefing will explore these questions through invited speakers while showcasing current capabilities available today. Vendor presentations will focus on case-studies and specific capabilities that may improve communication and response activities during an actual security incidents.
